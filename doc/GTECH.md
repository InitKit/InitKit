## #/g/technology on Rizon

This IRC channel claims to not be associated with 4chan.

This appears to be unlikely given that:
 * the channel has the same name as 4chan's 
   [technology forum](http://boards.4chan.org/g/)
 * the channel has the same topic of discussion as the 4chan board - technology
 * the channel frequently uses 4chan memes
 * the channel is largely frequented by 4chan users.
 * the channel had the following description on Rizon's channels listing,
 according to GitHub user @installgen2:
 ` 22:12 -- ChanServ (service@rizon.net): Description: Irc Channel for 4chan's resident technology board.`.

For some bizarre reason, the channel's owners threatened to send me a cease
and desist letter, or to sue me for defamation, if I maintained a reference
to their association with 4chan in the channel:

><witheld> It doesn't matter, a related name means nothing, and saying 
>something is related to 4chan is straight up defamation
><witheld> I'm writing up a C&D for him
><witheld> It's defaming the good character of the owners
><witheld> But anyway nah, we're just gonna go through github first
><witheld> they'll probably take care of it

><Uncled1023> Writing a description for a channel that the owner of said
 channel says is false is completely defamation

(did anyone else know that all it takes for David Duke to avoid being called
a nazi is for him to say, "I'm not a Nazi?")

In response to these very alarming threats, I have done as they said and
will not assert that their channel is 4chan related. I will leave it up to the
reader to decide that.
